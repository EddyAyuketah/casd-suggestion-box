remeber how we were working on the intel semiconductor dashboard, project, now i wanna create a new report
that helps the line because right now, we have a lot static lots in the line, that can be seen through the
lot path we used in our other project. and we need to find a way to pull these lots. 

i made this, 

lots = r"\\azshfs.intel.com\azanalysistop\AZAnalysis\1274_MAODATA\AZFSM_Production\COS_DB\Combined\LOTS.TXT"
df_lots = pd.read_csv(lots, sep="\t")
 
 
statics = (df_lots
           .loc[(df_lots['LOT_TYPE'] == 'PROD')]
           .loc[(df_lots['STOP_FLAG'] == 'S')]
           .loc[(df_lots['LOT_STATE'] == 'Active') | (df_lots['LOT_STATE'] == 'StoresMerge')]
           .loc[(df_lots['HAO'] >= 12)]
           .filter(["LOT","PRODUCT", "OPERATION", "OPER_SHORT_DESC","CEID", "AREA", 'LOT_PRIORITY',  'WAFER_QTY', "HAO", ])
)

however, its so limited because
we need  something that will print out COMMENTS on the lots that are impacting us.
