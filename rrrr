I need to update this line of code so that it pulls specific texts if there is text available associated with the SPL_INPUT for example, instead of pulling text like this "Tools required to hit REV_CAP: 18 When will toolset be Rev_Cap Capable? 1000 Tool Status: 17/20 Tool Details: 726.2 PMA recovery. NDT: 0930 726.3 SS OOC, RFC2 IP. NDT: 1000 743.2 PMA recovery. NDT:1100 Ramp Tools / CFD / Fung / Bagged tools: LAT714 - Mom UTP with AL3 down - LP t/s second half of S7 714.1 Unbagging, waiting on HB2 GCOLs data, tagged for EB1 L4471380 L4471370 714.2 E3 recovery and cycling i/p, UP for EB1 need to target BB1 and BB2 next. 726.1 ESC replacement recovery. MZ cal completed, then needs full mons, targeting, and GCOLs. BCETU: 11/22 Help needed? ___ When will INV <= Goal ___ (Include if toolset is in L1TF) EOW Projection: ___ (Include if toolset is in L1TF) Staffing % current shift:90% Staffing % next shift:80%"

instead, pull data like 
 Tools required to hit REV_CAP:18
When will toolset be Rev_Cap Capable?1000
Tool Status: 17/20
Tool details:  726.2 PMA recovery. NDT: 0930 726.3 SS OOC, RFC2 IP. NDT: 1000 743.2 PMA recovery. NDT:1100 Ramp Tools / CFD / Fung / Bagged tools: LAT714 - Mom UTP with AL3 down - LP t/s second half of S7 714.1 Unbagging, waiting on HB2 GCOLs data, tagged for EB1 L4471380 L4471370 714.2 E3 recovery and cycling i/p, UP for EB1 need to target BB1 and BB2 next. 726.1 ESC replacement recovery. MZ cal completed, then needs full mons, targeting, and GCOLs. BCETU: 11/22 Help needed?

It should not show anything after Help needed? ___ When will INV <= Goal ___ (Include if toolset is in L1TF) EOW Projection: ___ (Include if toolset is in L1TF) Staffing % current shift:90% Staffing % next shift:80%"
